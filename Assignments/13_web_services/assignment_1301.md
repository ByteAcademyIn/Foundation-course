### Extracting Data from JSON

The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, and compute the sum of the numbers in the file. <br/>

We provide two files for this assignment.<br/>
http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)<br/>
http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_64155.json (Sum ends with 64)

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL.
