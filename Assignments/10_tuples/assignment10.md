Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

Desired Output:

07 1<br/>
09 2<br/>
10 3<br/>
11 6<br/>
14 1<br/>
15 2<br/>
16 4<br/>
17 2<br/>
18 1<br/>
