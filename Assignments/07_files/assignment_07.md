WE ARE SURROUNDED IN OUR DAILY LIVES WITH COMPUTERS RANGING<br/>
FROM LAPTOPS TO CELL PHONES  WE CAN THINK OF THESE COMPUTERS<br/>
AS OUR PERSONAL ASSISTANTS WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF MANY THINGS<br/>
ON OUR BEHALF  THE HARDWARE IN OUR CURRENT-DAY COMPUTERS<br/>
IS ESSENTIALLY BUILT TO CONTINUOUSLY AS US THE QUESTION<br/>
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO NEXT<br/>

OUR COMPUTERS ARE FAST AND HAVE VASTS AMOUNTS OF MEMORY AND<br/>
COULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO US IF WE ONLY KNEW THE LANGUAGE TO<br/>
SPEAK TO EXPLAIN TO THE COMPUTER WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO<br/>
DO NEXT IF WE KNEW THIS LANGUAGE WE COULD TELL THE<br/>
COMPUTER TO DO TASKS ON OUR BEHALF THAT WERE REPTITIVE<br/>
INTERESTINGLY, THE KINDS OF THINGS COMPUTERS CAN DO BEST<br/>
ARE OFTEN THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HUMANS FIND BORING<br/>
AND MIND-NUMBING
