Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:<br/>
Score Grade<br/>
0.9 =< A<br/>
0.8 =< B<br/>
0.7 =< C<br/>
0.6 =< D<br/>
< 0.6 F<br/>
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit.
